# 📊 Diagram Explanation: Smart Home Energy Optimization

## 🧠 Components & Interactions

- **User**: Initiates the system and sets energy preferences.
- **System**: Authenticates and sets up connected IoT devices.
- **IoT Devices**: Continuously track energy use in real time.
- **Cloud Engine**: Collects and analyzes data to optimize usage.

## 🔍 Decision Logic

- When the system detects abnormal usage (peak hour, waste, etc.), it issues commands to optimize appliance behavior.
- If everything is normal, it just keeps monitoring.

## 📈 MIS Support

- **Informed Decisions**: Energy reports allow users to understand their habits.
- **Automation**: Devices respond without user intervention.
- **Data Flow**: From user input → IoT monitoring → cloud analytics → action.
